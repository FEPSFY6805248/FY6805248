<ex1><pre>This paper goes over the construction techniques and designs used in Hong Kong International Airport
  which was built to replace Hong Kongs previous international airport more commonly known as Kai Tak, 
  the new airport was predominantly constructed on reclaimed land and had one of the largest terminals in the world at the time.</pre></ex1>
 
  
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<ex1>Hong Kong international airport was designed as a replacement for its previous international airport known as “Kai Tak”.
Kai Tak was reaching capacity even after many upgrades since its initial opening in 1925 and a new higher capacity airport was needed (Kai Tak airport, 2021;<a href="#Dempsey">Dempsey</a>, 1999).</ex1>

<h3 id=”Analysis and discussion”>Analysis and discussion</h3>
<ex1>Due to design constraints of needing to minimize noise pollution so aircraft could land at all times of day and night, a factor that led to lower capacity for Kai Tak airport, the location of Chek Lap for a new international airport was chosen as it would allow aircraft to approach over the ocean and less populated areas instead of flying over central Hong Kong(Heard, 2017;<a href="#flight paths">Flight Paths</a>, 2023). The Land used for the airport is a mixture of existing land from Lantau and Lam islands and a total of 9 square kilometers of reclaimed seabed making a total area of the airport to be approximately 12 square kilometers (Facts and figures, HKIA at a glance, 2023; Heard, 2017).
Construction of the airport began in 1991, at the time of construction the Airports terminal 1 was the largest in the world at 13000 meters squared in area but this has now been superseded by other terminals like Dubai’s Dubai International Airport’s Terminal 3 at 1,713,000 meters squared (Institution of Civil Engineers (no date); Government of Dubai (no date))
During the land reclamation for the base of the airport “367 million m3 of stone gravel and sand were reclaimed” as well as 7 million m2 of artificial geotextiles by a company called Fibertex to allow free movement of water without materials being affected (<a href="#the world’s largest land reclamation">the world’s largest land reclamation</a> (no date)).
Hong Kong’s new international airport opened successfully after 7 years of construction on the 2nd of July 1998 (Institution of Civil Engineers (no date))
